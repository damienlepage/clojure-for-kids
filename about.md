This site is meant to teach some Clojure programming to kids, through a set of tutorials where they will build some simple games or applications.

Its philosophy is to let the students learn by doing as much as possible. Therefore it will not explore or explain concepts in-depth or in any particular order. The focus is on building something and (hopefully) having fun doing it.

Since it doesn't presume any previous knowledge of programming in general or Clojure in particular, the first project starts with some initial set-up and guide the student through the installation of the excellent [Nightcode](https://sekao.net/nightcode/)

Clojure's official web site is [https://clojure.org/](https://clojure.org/).

This site is built with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with the theme [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) slightly customized.
